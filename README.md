# Random Fantasy CS 2

Welcome to Random Fantasy CS 2, an entertaining project designed to assist you in selecting 5 random players with accurate pricing for your Counter Strike 2 Fantasy league. It uses a JSON sent from htlv.org API found during creating a team. Project was found because my friend noticed that in this season of fantasy its probably better to pick random teams instead of well-thought, carefully picked ones. We are currently checking that hypothesis :)
